# Short.in

Simple project that i make to strenghten my vue skills. using [Vue Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router) to make SPA(Single Page App), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to fetch data, [URLBAE](https://urlbae.com/developers) that provide API shorturl. And i know this project isnt good enough, but for me this project had me know deeper about how i make component with vue and how i use API.
